# Introduction 

**MonteCarlo.jl** is a package implementing classical and quantum Monte Carlo simulations primarily for solid state physics. Currently the focus is on finding a overall design for the package and verifying that determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) is working correctly. As such the package may still go through significant changes and the documentation may be outdated and incomplete.

Note that classical Monte Carlo is also not a focus at this point. It is probably usable, but a lot of the adjustments made to DQMC have not been added to classical Monte Carlo, or have been added without thorough testing.
